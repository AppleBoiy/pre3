# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy and procedures for the Prerequisite Tree repository. It describes how
security issues are handled, as well as how to report any vulnerabilities or concerns.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the Prerequisite Tree repository, please
email [contact.chaipat@gmail.com](mailto:contact.chaipat@gmail.com). It is important to provide sufficient details about
the vulnerability so that the maintainers can understand and address the issue effectively. Please refrain from publicly
disclosing any potential vulnerabilities until they have been addressed by the maintainers.

Once the maintainers receive your report, they will promptly review and triage the issue. They may need additional
information or clarification, and they will keep you informed about the progress and any steps being taken to address
the vulnerability.

## Supported Versions

The security policy applies to the latest version of the Prerequisite Tree repository. It is recommended to always use
the most up-to-date version to ensure you have the latest security patches and improvements. Older versions may not
receive security updates and could be vulnerable to known issues.

## Security Best Practices

When using or contributing to the Prerequisite Tree repository, it is essential to follow these security best practices:

- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly check for updates to the project dependencies and ensure you are using the
  latest secure versions.
- **Secure access**: Make sure only authorized individuals have access to the repository and its resources.
- **Code review**: Review code changes thoroughly to identify any potential security vulnerabilities or issues.
- **Secure coding practices**: Follow secure coding practices, such as input validation, proper error handling, and
  protection against common vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
- **Report security concerns**: If you come across any security concerns or suspicious activity related to the
  Prerequisite Tree repository, report them to the maintainers immediately.

## Acknowledgements
